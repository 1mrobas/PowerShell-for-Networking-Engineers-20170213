.SYNOPSIS
Creates SSH sessions to remote SSH-compatible hosts, such as Linux
or Unix computers or network equipment. You can later issue commands
to be executed on one or more of these hosts.

.DESCRIPTION
Once you've created a session, you can use Invoke-SshCommand or Enter-SshSession
to send commands to the remote host or hosts.

The authentication is done here. If you specify -KeyFile, that will be used.
If you specify a password and no key, that will be used. If you do not specify
a key nor a password, you will be prompted for a password, and you can enter
it securely with asterisks displayed in place of the characters you type in.

.PARAMETER ComputerName
Required. DNS names or IP addresses for target hosts to establish
a connection to using the provided username and key/password.
.PARAMETER Username
Required. The username used for connecting.
.PARAMETER KeyFile
Optional. Specify the path to a private key file for authenticating.
Overrides a specified password.
.PARAMETER Password
Optional. You can specify a key, or leave out the password to be prompted
for a password which is typed in interactively and will not be displayed.
.PARAMETER Port
Optional. Default 22. Target port the SSH server uses.

.SYNOPSIS
Invoke/run commands via SSH on target hosts to which you have already opened
connections using New-SshSession. See Get-Help New-SshSession.

.DESCRIPTION
Execute/run/invoke commands via SSH.

You are already authenticated and simply specify the target(s) and the command.

Output is emitted to the pipeline, so you collect results by using:
$Result = Invoke-SshCommand [...]

$Result there would be either a System.String if you target a single host or a
System.Array containing strings if you target multiple hosts.

If you do not specify -Quiet, you will also get colored Write-Host output - mostly
for the sake of displaying progress.

Use -InvokeOnAll to invoke on all hosts to which you have opened connections.
The hosts will be processed in alphabetically sorted order.

.PARAMETER ComputerName
Target hosts to invoke command on.
.PARAMETER Command
Required. The Linux command to run on specified target computers.
.PARAMETER Quiet
Causes no colored output to be written by Write-Host. If you assign results to a
variable, no progress indication will be shown.
.PARAMETER InvokeOnAll
Invoke the specified command on all computers for which you have an open connection.
Overrides -ComputerName, but you will be asked politely if you want to continue,
if you specify both parameters.

.SYNOPSIS
Shows all, or the specified, SSH sessions in the global $SshSessions variable,
along with the connection status.

.DESCRIPTION
It checks if they're still reported as connected and reports that too. However,
they can have a status of "connected" even if the remote computer has rebooted.
Seems like an issue with the SSH.NET library and how it maintains this status.

If you specify hosts with -ComputerName, which don't exist in the $SshSessions
variable, the "Connected" value will be "NULL" for these hosts.

Also be aware that with the version of the SSH.NET library at the time of writing,
the host will be reported as connected even if you use the .Disconnect() method
on it. When you invoke the .Dispose() method, it does report the connection status
as false.

.PARAMETER ComputerName
Optional. The default behavior is to list all hosts alphabetically, but this
lets you specify hosts to target specifically. NULL is returned as the connection
status if a non-existing host name/IP is passed in.
